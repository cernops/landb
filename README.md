CERN LANDB Client
=================

What is it?
-----------
This is a library providing an object abstraction for CERN's [LANDB service].
The library interfaces with the SOAP API [provided by LANDB] (NetworkService)
to allow developers to easily interact with this information. At the moment this
library provides basic read-only functionality through the provided client
objects, but write support should be added soon.
